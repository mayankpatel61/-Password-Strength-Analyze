# Password-Strength-Analyze
**Step 1: Project Overview**
The goal of this project is to create a tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria, such as
length, complexity, and common vulnerabilities.
Step 2: Tools and Technologies
Here’s what you’ll need:
Programming Language: Python (recommended for its simplicity and libraries).
Libraries:
re (for regular expressions to check patterns).
hashlib (for hashing comparisons, if needed).
getpass (to securely input passwords).
Concepts: Password policies, hashing, and entropy.
Step 3: Features to Implement
Here are some features you can include to make your project stand out:
1. Password Length Check: Ensure the password is at least 8-12 characters long.
2. Complexity Check: Verify the password contains a mix of:
Uppercase letters
Lowercase letters
Numbers
Special characters
3. Common Password Check: Compare the password against a list of common passwords (e.g., "123456",
"password").
4. Entropy Calculation: Calculate the password’s entropy to measure its strength.
5. Feedback System: Provide actionable feedback to the user (e.g., "Add a special character").
6. Hashing Comparison: (Optional) Hash the password and compare it to a list of hashed passwords to check for
duplicates.
