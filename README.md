# Password Strength Analyzer

This project is a **Python-based tool** that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria, such as length, complexity, and common vulnerabilities. It also includes a **user-friendly GUI** built with `tkinter` and features like a **progress bar**, **color-coded feedback**, and the ability to **save results** to a file.

---

## Features
- **Password Length Check**: Ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.
- **Complexity Check**: Verifies the password contains a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
- **Common Password Check**: Compares the password against a list of common passwords.
- **Entropy Calculation**: Measures the password's strength using entropy.
- **Progress Bar**: Visually indicates password strength.
- **Color-Coded Feedback**: Displays results in red (weak), orange (moderate), or green (strong).
- **Save Results**: Allows users to save the analysis to a `.txt` file.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Tkinter**: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Regular Expressions (re)**: For pattern matching and complexity checks.
- **File Handling**: For saving results to a file.
