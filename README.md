# Password-Strength-Analyze
## ProjectOverview

The goal of this project is to create a tool that evaluates the strength of a password based on various criteria, such as
length, complexity, and common vulnerabilities.

## Tools and Technologies


### 1. Programming Language:
Python (recommended for its simplicity and libraries).
   
### 2. Libraries:

+ **re** (for regular expressions to check patterns).

+ **hashlib** (for hashing comparisons, if needed).

- **getpass** (to securely input passwords).

Concepts: Password policies, hashing, and entropy.

### 3: Features to Implement
Here are some features I include to make my project :

1. Password Length Check: Ensure the password is at least 8-12 characters long.

2. Complexity Check: Verify the password contains a mix of:
+ Uppercase letters
+ Lowercase letters
+ Numbers
+ Special characters
3. Common Password Check: Compare the password against a list of common passwords (e.g., "123456",
"password").
4. Entropy Calculation: Calculate the passwordâ€™s entropy to measure its strength.
5. Feedback System: Provide actionable feedback to the user (e.g., "Add a special character").
6. Hashing Comparison: (Optional) Hash the password and compare it to a list of hashed passwords to check for
duplicates.
